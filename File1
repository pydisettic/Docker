## Installation Process of docker on a new Centos/RedHat Linux Machines

By default only `root` user can run the commands and as we are using centos user by default so we want `docker` commands to be executed as centos user.
For that we need a group and add `centos` user to that group.

Containers are not created to run your STATEFULL WORKLOADS

```
$ sudo groupadd docker
$ sudo usermod -a -G docker centos

```

After that logout and login once again.

```
$ sudo yum install docker -y 
$ sudo systemctl enable docker 
$ sudo systemctl start docker
```

Run the following command to ensure docker is running and you have permission to execute it.

```
$ docker version
```
This should show both the Docker Client and the Server which means that you've complete access on the repository.

### How to supply env variables during the run time of the container

```
docker run -d -e MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD=password mariadb
```


### Volume Mapping 
```
Docker cannot persist the state, which means when you stop / start /destroy, the data on it won't be persisted.
So to persist the data, we do something called as volume mapping
```

## Ensure you use the 8.7.1 version of sonarqube as the latest sonarQube has 11 & 17 of openJDK which create incompatibility issues to our project
```
docker run -d  -p 9000:9000 -v /home/centos/sonardata:/opt/sonarqube/data sonarqube:8.7.1-community
```



### To Start a Mariadb container :
```
$ docker run -d -p 3306:3306 -e MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD=student1 mariadb

$ docker run -d -p 3306:3306  -v /home/centos/mariadb:/var/lib/mysql -e MARIADB_ROOT_PASSWORD=student1 mariadb
 
 * This ensures data will be persisted

```

### This is how you connect to the DB Server :

```
 $ docker exec -it 2ec77eba7ad8 bash

 root@2ec77eba7ad8:/# mysql -uroot -pstudent1
